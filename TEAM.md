## Team Workflow

- Features are developed in separate branches created from `main`.
- Each task or feature has its own branch, named clearly (e.g., `feature/login`, `bugfix/cart-total`).
- Developers commit small, logical changes with clear commit messages.

### Code Review & Collaboration

- Pull requests are created when a feature or fix is ready.
- At least one teammate reviews the pull request.
- Reviewers check for code quality, logic, readability, and standards.
- Feedback is addressed before approval.
- Merging into `main` is allowed only after all required reviews pass.

### Testing & Quality

- Developers test their changes locally before opening a pull request.
- Automated tests and CI checks must pass before merging.
- Bugs found during review or testing are fixed in the same branch.

### Release & Maintenance

- `main` always represents stable, production-ready code.
- Hotfixes are created from `main` if urgent issues appear in production.
- After release, the team monitors for issues and plans improvements.
